# 📝 **Project Reflection (Mandatory)**

## ✅ 1. Step-by-Step Process I Followed

### **Step 1 — Understanding the Task Requirements**
I reviewed the internship task document carefully and understood that the goal was to build **three responsive pages** using Bootstrap 5 and deploy them using GitHub Pages. The document emphasized remixing Bootstrap components rather than copying complete templates.

### **Step 2 — Planning the Project**
I structured the project into three main HTML files and an optional CSS file.

### **Step 3 — Exploring Bootstrap Documentation**
I explored:
- Navbar  
- Hero/Jumbotron  
- Cards  
- Forms  
- Grid system  

This helped me understand how to combine components effectively.

### **Step 4 — Designing the Pages**
I created:
- A Home page with hero + feature cards  
- An About page with an image + text layout  
- A Contact page with a functional form layout  

### **Step 5 — Ensuring Responsiveness**
I tested layouts across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes and used Bootstrap grid classes for responsiveness.

### **Step 6 — Hosting via GitHub Pages**
I uploaded the files to GitHub and deployed the project using **Settings → Pages → Deploy from Branch**.

## ✅ 2. Tools & Resources Used (Transparency)

### ✔ Bootstrap 5 Documentation  
Used for understanding components and layout system.

### ✔ ChatGPT  
Used for guidance, template generation, and debugging support.  
Final customization and editing were done manually.

### ✔ GitHub  
Used for version control and deployment.

### ✔ Google/StackOverflow  
Used when I needed clarification on utility classes or deployment issues.

_No full templates were copied; I remixed and customized Bootstrap components._

## ✅ 3. Challenges Faced & How I Solved Them

### **Challenge 1 — Combining Bootstrap Components Creatively**  
It was challenging to design unique pages instead of copying examples.  
**Solution:** I combined navbars, cards, forms, hero sections, and custom structures from multiple examples.

### **Challenge 2 — Making Pages Fully Responsive**  
Some elements broke on small screens.  
**Solution:** I adjusted grid classes (`col-md-6`, `col-lg-4`) and spacing utilities.

### **Challenge 3 — GitHub Pages Deployment**  
Initially confusing.  
**Solution:** Followed GitHub Pages documentation and configured deployment correctly.
